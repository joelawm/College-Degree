# College Degree and outside of school learning
This reposirty contains all 4 years of my Undergraduate degree at NIU for Computer Sceince. This reposirty also contains anything i worked on outside of school, so YouTube Series, Udemy Courses, non-security enfringing work documents, and general reading. If youre looking at this, this will let you know a small part of what I have done in my life.
