# College Degree and outside of school learning
This reposirty contains all 4 years of my Undergraduate degree at NIU for Computer Sceince. This reposirty also contains anything I worked on outside of school, so YouTube Series, Udemy Courses, non-security enfringing work documents, and general reading. If you're looking at this, this will let you know a small part of what I have done in my life. All my other repositories are based around projects I have been working on.

## CSCI 240 : Computer Prgrogramming in C++
Instructor: Amy Byrnes
###### Overview
Computer Science 240 was a very basic introduction to C++. It just went over gnereal information on C++ such as variables, arrays, functions and statments. I already had a good understanding for the basics from coding in high school and projects in highschool. Still this was my first few C++ programs.

###### Languages
C++

###### Assignments
1. Assignment 0
    - This is just a simple 'Hello World' program.
2. Assignment 1
    - This program was just about taking in two numbers and doing simple expressions to change the output. 
3. Assignment 2
    - This program is just a simple tip calcualtor using floats and a few diffrent precision statements.
4. Assignment 3
    - This program will take the users input for a subscription and then return the cost for it.
5. Assignment 4
    - This program takes in 9 random numerbes and adds the together, finds the average and standard deviation of the 9 numbers.
6. Assignment 5
    - This is a simple Roulette Game where you can  place bets and the computer will tell you if you have won or lost.
7. Assignment 6
    - This program performs simple arithmetic calculations and displays the results.
8. Assignment 7
    - This program performs simple arithmetic calculations to arrays and displays the results.
9. Assignment 8
    - This finally implements the idea of methods and functions to our programming toolbox.
10. Assignment 9
    - This is the first program to use classes to create a soccer game program.
11. Assignment 10
    - This is a game to make a simulated card game called black jack. It has 2 players to the game.

## CSCI 241 : Intermidiate Programming
Instructor: Kurt McMahon
###### Overview
Computer Science 241 is the successor to 240. This is where the ideas of OOP and Modern C++ come into play. We learn more about why were doing the things that were doing, and how it works. 

###### Languages
C++

###### Assignments

## CSCI 330 : UNIX and the Network Programming
Instructor: Raimund Ege
###### Overview
Computer Science 330 is a Linux based class. This class is just about learning how to use linux and running commands through a Linux partition (Linux Mint). I have no work to show for this class because it was more of a 'follow these instructions on a terminal', but I have several Linux servers running at home. So below I will put my personal projects you can ask me about if you're curious.

###### Languages
BASH, C++

###### Assignments
1. ZFS/ soon to be GlusterFS File Server
    - This is a old quad core server running 3 2TB drives in Raidz-1. Its simple for now but once I get some money I do plan to throw in a HBA card and get 8 more drives running in Raidz-2.
2. Compute Server
    - This server I have a small graphics card that I off board my Machine Learning Projects to. Its whole purpose is to just sit there and data train. This too I'd like to upgrade in to a single U rack mountable server with 4 blower style cards. That being said I need more money to do so.

## Udemy C++ Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond :: IN-PROGRESS
Instructor: Frank Mitropoulos
###### Overview
I bought this course to help refresh/harden my knowldege on C++. Most of my College degree has had some sort of C++ in the class, but I found that I wasn't perfect when it came to discussing even jsut the basics. I knew how to program in C++ and do even data structures in C++ but some of the basics I missed or I felt I didn't know it as well as I wanted. I prett much flew through this course but it was helpful in refreshing my knowledge.
