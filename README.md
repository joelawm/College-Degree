# College Degree and outside of school learning
This reposirty contains all 4 years of my Undergraduate degree at NIU for Computer Sceince. This reposirty also contains anything I worked on outside of school, so YouTube Series, Udemy Courses, non-security enfringing work documents, and general reading. If you're looking at this, this will let you know a small part of what I have done in my life. All my other repositories are based around projects I have been working on.

## CSCI 240 : Computer Prgrogramming in C++
Instructor: Amy Byrnes
###### Overview
Computer Science 240 was a very basic introduction to C++. It just went over gnereal information on C++ such as variables, arrays, functions and statments. I already had a good understanding for the basics from coding in high school and projects in highschool. Still this was my first few C++ programs.

## CSCI 330 : UNIX and the Network Programming
Instructor: Raimund Ege
###### Overview
Computer Science 330 is a Linux based class. This class is just about learning how to use linux and running commands through a Linux partition (Linux Mint). I have no work to show for this class because it was more of a 'follow these instructions on a terminal', but I have several Linux servers running at home. So below I will put my personal projects you can ask me about if you're curious.

###### Languages
BASH, C++

###### Assignments
1. ZFS/ soon to be GlusterFS File Server
    - This is a old quad core server running 3 2TB drives in Raidz-1. Its simple for now but once I get some money I do plan to throw in a HBA card and get 8 more drives running in Raidz-2.
2. Compute Server
    - This server I have a small graphics card that I off board my Machine Learning Projects to. Its whole purpose is to just sit there and data train. This too I'd like to upgrade in to a single U rack mountable server with 4 blower style cards. That being said I need more money to do so.
