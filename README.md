# College Degree and outside of school learning
This reposirty contains all 4 years of my Undergraduate degree at NIU for Computer Sceince. This reposirty also contains anything i worked on outside of school, so YouTube Series, Udemy Courses, non-security enfringing work documents, and general reading. If you're looking at this, this will let you know a small part of what I have done in my life. All my other repositries are based around projects I was working on.

## Udemy C++ Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond :: IN-PROGRESS
Instructor: Frank Mitropoulos
###### Overview
I bought this course to help refresh/harden my knowldege on C++. Most of my College degree has had some sort of C++ in the class, but I found that I wasn't perfect when it came to discussing even jsut the basics. I knew how to program in C++ and do even data structures in C++ but some of the basics I missed or I felt I didn't know it as well as I wanted. I prett much flew through this course but it was helpful in refreshing my knowledge.

###### Languages
C++

###### Assignments
1. Section 1: Structure of a C++ Program
    - This just goes over the preprocessor and basics of the C++ main() function and namespaces.
2. Section 2: Variables and Constants
    - This section goes over vairbales in modern C++.
